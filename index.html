            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

            <p>Shinichi Kudo (工藤 新一 Kudō Shin'ichi?) is the high school detective,
              narrator and main protagonist of the manga and anime Detective Conan.
              While on a date with his childhood friend and romantic interest Ran Mouri,
              Shinichi encounters two men from a secret criminal organization who force
              feed him a strange poison that causes his body to shrink back to first grade age.
              Shinichi takes up the alias Conan Edogawa and plans to use his immense skill as a
              detective to make Ran's bumbling private detective father famous in hopes that he will
              find a case involving the secret organization so he can expose its crimes and acquire an
              antidote that will turn him back into a teenager.</p>

              <br></br>

            <h2>PERSONALITY</h2>
            <p>At the beginning of the series, Shinichi is already well-known as a brilliant young detective,
               the "Savior of the police force", for solving many difficult cases the professionals could not.
                He is extremely intelligent, and even from a young age was very intuitive and observant.
                Due to the influence of his father and the general laissez-faire environment at home, he has
                long been an incessant and persistent reader, especially of mystery novels. His father,
                Yusaku started taking Shinichi to crime scenes as a child, which inspired him to be a detective.
                 Due to his bluntness and matter-of-fact manner, Shinichi can come off as rude and arrogant.
                 However, he cares deeply about human life, unable to understand how any reason could be sufficient
                 motive for murder, and is convinced that driving a culprit to suicide is no better than murder itself.
                 The few times he has been too late to save a life haunt him throughout the series.</p>

              <br></br>
              <h2>SKILLS</h2>

              <p>
                <h3>Intelligence</h3>
                Consistently, Shinichi has proven himself to be a very sharp-witted and calculating individual.
                While only in high school, his passion mysterious have lead him to be a very well-read and methodical in
                investigations. His detective skills often earns him comparisons to Sherlock Holmes. Shinichi has acquired
                various nicknames because of his prowess, such as the "Heisei Holmes" and the "Detective of the East".
                He has a keen eye for details, and can spot any unusual aspects in a case that most people tend to miss or not
                take into account. He repeatedly demonstrates an eidetic memory and perfect recall, able to recount every aspect
                from the situation he has placed himself in. Shinichi's fastidious attention to detail allows him to notice minor
                inconsistencies in crime scenes and suspect testimony, and using astute logic he uncovers the reasons behind those
                inconsistencies in order to link them to the crime. Shinichi has extraordinarily broad and deep knowledge of many
                subjects and trivia that help him solve cases. Few people are able to match wits with him, including Heiji Hattori
                and Kaito Kuroba, while only his father, Yusaku Kudo, has shown able consistently proven himself to far surpass
                his son, both solving mysterious well-before Shinichi and even regularly tricking his on for "tests".

                <h3>Language</h3>
                Besides his native language, Shinichi is fluent in English, as seen when he solved a case in London without
                evidence of any language barrier. Shinichi also knows some German, and Italian. Shinichi seems
                to understand "Girl Writing", due to the fact that he had solved an e-mail cipher of a 2nd year high school girl
                quickly

                <h3>Athletic Ability</h3>
                Like his intelligence, Shinichi also has an amazing athletic ability. Shinichi is an extremely skilled soccer player,
                having been professionally scouted while only in middle school, but he chooses to stay at the amateur level.
                He initially played to hone his reflexes and often juggles a ball to clear his mind, but he is also an enthusiastic
                fan of the sport in its own right. In battle, his signature technique is launching various objects with superb
                precision from his kick at the criminal. Shinichi's kick is accurate over long distances and he is capable of mentally
                reckoning the angle of impact necessary to rebound a soccer ball off a wall and strike an attacker from behind.
                He is also good at skiing and snowboarding. Aside from sports, Shinichi exhibits a knack and impeccable accuracy
                for handling firearms due to his father taking him to shooting ranges from time to time. During the Clocktower Heist,
                Shinichi is able to shoot and dislodge the support beam of a giant projection screen with a single shot from a moving helicopter.
                Additionally, in The Fourteenth Target, Conan shot a bullet at Ran's leg with such precision, that while it rendered her
                unable to walk to force the criminal to let her go, but afterwards her leg healed cleanly with no lingering signs or damage.

                <h3>Music</h3>
                Shinichi cannot sing on key in the slightest so he is often accused of being tone deaf. Despite being a hilariously awful singer,
                Shinichi has perfect pitch and can identify notes accurately even in difficult contexts like the sound of phone button presses forming a melody.
                Also, to be like his favorite detective, Sherlock Holmes, he plays the violin. This was confirmed in Full Score of Fear, when he
                played "Amazing Grace" for Ran.
